# Files
This repository contains `.xcf` files and `.jpg` files.

`.xcf` files are GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program - free software), that you can freely modify to your needs.

`.jpg` files are already exported images.

With GIMP files, you have all layers and other stuff that I used, in order to create those images, so you have more data to freely modify.
